# basicproperties <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

R package for the calculation of a set of very basic statistical properties of time-series data.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `basicproperties` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/basicproperties")
```

## Usage

Users can compute all the features in `basicproperties` at once using the main function `get_properties`. This can be run in a one-liner as it only takes an input vector as an argument. Here is a demonstration on a vector of $1000$ samples generated from an AR(1) process:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(basicproperties)
y <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = 0.8), n = 1000)
outs <- get_properties(y)
outs
```
